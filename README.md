+# Nethest
+Nethest is a nether implementation for Minetest. There are a few implementations yet, but I couldn't find a one with a really Minecraft-like world generation.
+
+As other implementations, the nether is generated very deep in the earth.
+
+## Current status
+Not implemented
+
+## Position translation
+When you step through a portal at position (x,y,z), you will come out at (x/8,y/32,z/8).
+
+## Build a portal
+ToDo: Obsidian shape
